# Javascript components

Folder contains simple .js, with simple export functions of html components

Other scripts will handle uploading them to the DOM, being the components only responsible
for returning html strings.

The components use the extension *es6-string-html* from vscode to show html highlighting even as 
js string.


# Subfolders

Components may also be part of another component, or children.
For the time being, they are separated on different folders, such as on the profile case
