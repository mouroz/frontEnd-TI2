deplayment of new layouts and models

there are multiple possible themes and skins that could make the website better,
from different headers to different css for those headers. This folder carries on
those new models, each a folder with a standartX.html, indexX.html and the new changed css.

this method requires more modularization, but with that implemented correctly, changes to layout
will be as simple as copying and pasting over a module (such as header) and changing the css stylesheet
